## Nioh 2 Trainer
An external trainer for the game Nioh 2 written in C# with .NET Framework. This project is still being worked on and is expected to have a GUI interface as well as additional features. Currently, the trainer contains the following functionality: Godmode, OneHitKill, Infinite Stamina, Infinite Anime, Instant Yonkai Charge, Instant Yonkai Cooldown, and Infinite Yonkai Time. This is a .NET Framework WPF project created using Visual Studio 2022.

## Instructions
To use this application the user must either compile the project themselves or download the executable provided. Also, the user must have .NET Framework installed on their computer. Below I have provided step-by-step instructions on how to run the trainer.

### Step By Step
  * Download and install .NET Framework from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework
  * Download the Nioh 2 Trainer executable from this repository(v1.0.0 targets .NET Framework 4.7.2)
  * Launch the Nioh 2 video game and start an in-game session
  * Once the character is in-game the user can launch the executable
  * Enjoy playing the game with the trainer :)
  

## Project Goal
My goal for this project is to create a trainer for the game Nioh 2 written in C# with a XAML GUI. I want to learn C# while applying what I learn and this seems like an interesting project to do. This project also dives more into reverse engineering as I try to apply more tools such as Cheat Engine, ReClass, x64DBG, and Ghidra to get a better understanding of the inner workings of the game.

## Help
This project could not have been built without the excellent tutorials provided by GuidedHacking, CheatTheGame, StackOverflow, and Microsoft. The process of finding offsets, reverse engineering, and writing the code required for memory reading/writing was learned from GuidedHacking and CheatTheGame. While the process of writing a C# based tool was learned from StackOverflow and Microsoft.
